## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Search results panel not found"

**Solution**: The page may have taken longer to load. Try increasing the timeout:

```bash
node src/index.js "your query" --timeout 20000
```

### Issue: "No results found"

**Solution**:

- Check your search query for typos
- Try a broader search term
- Ensure you have an internet connection

### Issue: Browser not launching

**Solution**:

- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Try running in non-headless mode: `--headless false`
- On Linux, you may need additional dependencies for Chrome

### Issue: Low data completion rates

**Solution**:

- Some businesses may not have all fields available on Google Maps
- Try increasing the timeout for better results: `--timeout 15000`
- Run in non-headless mode to see what's happening: `--headless false`

## Important Notes

### Legal & Ethical Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: This tool is intended for educational and personal use only.

- Respect Google's Terms of Service
- Do not use for commercial data reselling
- Implement rate limiting to avoid IP blocks
- Consider Google Maps API for commercial use cases

### Rate Limiting

To avoid being blocked:

- Don't run multiple instances simultaneously
- Add delays between searches
- Limit max results when testing
- Use a VPN if making many requests

### Maintenance

Google Maps' HTML structure may change over time, which could affect the tool's functionality. If you notice extraction failures:

1. Check the `extraction_errors.log` file
2. Selectors in `src/config.js` may need updating
3. Run in non-headless mode to inspect the page structure

## Performance Tips

- **Headless Mode**: Faster when running in headless mode (default)
- **Max Results**: Limit results for faster extraction during testing
- **Timeout**: Increase timeout for slower connections
- **Parallel Processing**: The tool processes sequentially for stability
